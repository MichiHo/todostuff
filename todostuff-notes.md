    -   Tag entries as "today"
    -   Show entries done, tagged or created today in same panel
-   Better filters for panels
    -   Property values bigger / smaller than
    -   Live preview -> Possibility to use it while editable-header not locked for filtering
-   Date support for due:
-   Intellisense-like suggestions and highlighting in newEntry, editEntry and editPanel
-   One Task depend on another, show smaller (indented?) until parent is done
